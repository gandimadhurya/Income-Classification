# Income-Classification
In this project I applied supervised learning techniques to determine the income of an individual from the census dataset. 
After exploring the data to learn how the census data is recorded, applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
Then I passed this transformed data into several models and chose an optimized model for this dataset. 
Then evaluating several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
Afterwards, Optimized the model I've selected and present it as my solution. 
For a deeper understanding of the project I tuned the model by extracting the top 5 features and passed them into the optimized model. I've explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

Software and Libraries. This project uses the following software and Python libraries:
  - Python 2.7
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn (v0.17)
  - matplotlib
  - Jupyter Notebook
  
 List of files - Description : 
  - census.csv: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
  - visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
  - income_classification.ipynb: This is the main notebook file for the project.
  - Source.gv.pdf - stores pictorial representation of decision tree in pdf format everytime the notebook file is run.
