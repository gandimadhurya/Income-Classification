# Income-Classification
Machine Learning project which determines the income of an individual from the census dataset. This is a supervised learning model. In this project, I applpied several supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected from the census. After data exploration, I performed few transformations on it to make the data ready for modelling. Then I passed this transformed data into several models and chose an optimized model for this dataset. Though the project seems to be completed at this point, for my curiosity I tuned the model by extracting the top 5 features and passed them into the optimized model. Final results seemed very interesting. 

Software and Libraries This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python 2.7
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn (v0.17)
matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
