# Income-Classification
Machine Learning project which determines the income of an individual from the census dataset. This is a supervised learning model. In this project, I applpied several supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected from the census. After data exploration, I performed few transformations on it to make the data ready for modelling. Then I passed this transformed data into several models and chose an optimized model for this dataset. For a deeper understanding of the project I tuned the model by extracting the top 5 features and passed them into the optimized model. I've explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

Software and Libraries This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python 2.7
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn (v0.17)
matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
